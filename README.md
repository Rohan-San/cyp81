# CYP81

### Objective 1
How [This Smart Contract](https://github.com/Rohan-San/cyp81/blob/main/Backend/Smart%20Contracts/DPoS_Voting.sol) Achieves Scalability:
1. Delegation Mechanism: Voters can delegate their voting rights to trusted candidates (validators), reducing on-chain transactions.
2. Efficient Voting Process: Instead of every voter submitting a transaction, a few delegates cast votes, significantly reducing network congestion.
3. Admin Controls: The election admin can add candidates and control election phases.
4. Results Computation: Fetches the winner without additional computation costs.
